                Hello! My name is Alejandro Malanche, a recent graduate from the University of California San Diego with a B.S. in Computer Engineering looking for entry level software engineering positions.  
                Ever since I was a child, I was always fascinated with video games and was always very interested how people made such complex designs and movement systems 
                which helped spark my interest in techonlogy in general growing up. Getting to see how crucial technology and software are to our modern world and all the ways they can used,
                inspired me to follow this path of getting into the software industry knowing that the software that I could help create can reach many people.
